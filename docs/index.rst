Overview
===================================

`Openapy` simplifies continuous development with `OpenAPI Generator <https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator>`_.
What this tool does is read python source files and split functions into individual files.
This will prevent the openapi generator from overwriting the code you have written.
